# routeleaks

Route leaks occur when improper network prefixes are advertised and propagated throughout the network leading to packet loss. Having an automated approach to detect and correct route leaks is beneficial. In this research, an Enterprise environment was emulated with Autonomous Systems (AS) running Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and a server storing telemetry route data. A network design that detects route leak efficiently and blocks the leaked traffic with the Engineer’s approval was implemented by using prefix lists on edge devices. The proposed detection mechanism considers factors like BGP origin AS, timestamp, and network prefix. The Routing Information Base (RIB) data is stored and analyzed in a database from which the developed algorithm fetches the data for route leak detection, and the alerting system notifies the hijacked AS when a route leak is detected. The results of the algorithm developed enables real-time route leak detection, alerts the respective enterprise, and blocks the network within the local enterprise upon user’s approval. A montoring system using Grafana enables real-time traffic monitoring to check for any origin AS changes for a particular prefix over time.
